# DESCRIPTION ##################################################################
#' @description
#' This function assesses premature deaths or years of life lost (YLL) attributable to exposure to an environmental stressor using a life table approach.

# ARGUMENTS ####################################################################
#' @inheritParams attribute_master

# DETAILS ######################################################################
#' @details
#' \strong{Function arguments}
#' @details
#' \code{age_group}
#' @details
#' The numeric values must refer to 1 year age groups, e.g. \code{c(0:99)}. To convert multi-year/larger age groups to 1 year age groups use the function \code{prepare_lifetable()} (see its function documentation for more info).
#' @details
#' \code{bhd_central,bhd_lower,bhd_upper}
#' @details
#' Deaths per age must be inputted with 1 value per age (i.e. age group size = 1 year). There must be greater than or equal to 1 deaths per age to avoid issues during the calculation of survival probabilities.
#' @details
#' \code{population}
#' @details
#' The population data must be inputted with 1 value per age (i.e. age group size = 1 year). The values must be greater than or equal to 1 per age to avoid issues during the calculation of survival probabilities.
#' @details
#' Mid-year population of year x can be approximated as the mean of either end-year populations of years x-1 and x or start-of-year populations of years x and x+1. For each age, the inputted values must be greater than or equal to 1 to avoid issues during the calculation of survival probabilities.
#' @details
#' \code{approach_newborns}
#' @details
#' If \code{"with_newborns"} is selected, it is assumed that for each year after the year of analysis n babies (population aged 0) are born.
#' @details
#' \code{time_horizon}
#' @details
#' Applicable for the following cases:
#' #' \itemize{
#'  \item YLL: \code{single_year} or \code{constant} exposure
#'  \item premature deaths: \code{constant} exposure
#' }
#' For example, if 10 is entered one is interested in the impacts of exposure during the year of analysis and the next 9 years (= 10 years in total). Default value: length of the numeric vector specified in the \code{age_group} argument.
#' @details
#' \code{min_age}, \code{max_age}
#' The \code{min_age} default value 30 implies that all adults aged 30 or older will be affected by the exposure; \code{max_age} analogeously specifies the age above which no health effects of the exposure are considered.

#' @details
#' \strong{Conversion of multi-year to single year age groups}
#' @details
#' To convert multi-year/larger age groups to 1 year age groups use the function \code{prepare_lifetable()} and see its function documentation for more info.

#' @details
#' \strong{Life table methodology}
#' @details
#' The life table methodology of \code{attribute_lifetable()} follows that of the WHO tool AirQ+, and is described in more detail by Miller & Hurley (2003, https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.57.3.200).
#' @details
#' In short, two scenarios are compared: 1) a scenario with the exposure level specified in the function ("exposed scenario") and 2) a scenario with no exposure ("unexposed scenario"). First, the entry and mid-year populations of the (first) year of analysis in the unexposed scenario is determined using modified survival probabilities. Second, age-specific population projections using scenario-specific survival probabilities are done for both scenarios. Third, by subtracting the populations in the unexposed scenario from the populations in the exposed scenario the premature deaths/years of life lost attributable to the exposure are determined.
#' @details
#' An expansive life table case study by Miller (2010) is available here: https://cleanair.london/app/uploads/CAL-098-Mayors-health-study-report-June-2010-1.pdf.

#' @details
#' \emph{\strong{Determination of populations in the (first) year of analysis}}
#' @details
#' The entry (i.e. start of year) populations in both scenarios is determined as follows:
#' \deqn{entry\_population_{year_1} = midyear\_population_{year_1} + \frac{deaths_{year_1}}{2}}
#' @details
#' \emph{\strong{Exposed scenario}} The survival probabilities in the exposed scenario from start of year i to start of year i+1  are calculated as follows:
#' \deqn{prob\_survival = \frac{midyear\_population_i - \frac{deaths_i}{2}}{midyear\_population_i + \frac{deaths_i}{2}}}
#' Analogously, the probability of survival from start of year i to mid-year i:
#' \deqn{prob\_survival\_until\_midyear = 1 - \frac{1 - prob\_survival}{2}}
#' @details
#' \emph{\strong{Unexposed scenario}} The survival probabilities in the unexposed scenario are calculated as follows:
#' @details
#' First, the age-group specific hazard rate in the exposed scenario is calculated using the inputted age-specific mid-year populations and deaths.
#' \deqn{hazard\_rate = \frac{deaths}{mid\_year\_population}}
#' Second, the hazard rate is multiplied with the modification factor (\eqn{= 1 - PAF}) to obtain the age-specific hazard rate in the unexposed scenario.
#' \deqn{hazard\_rate\_mod = hazard\_rate \times modification\_factor}
#' Third, the the age-specific survival probabilities (from the start until the end in a given age group) in the unexposed scenario are calculated as follows (cf. Miller & Hurley 2003):
#' \deqn{prob\_survival\_mod = \frac{2-hazard\_rate\_mod}{2+hazard\_rate\_mod}}
#' Then the mid-year populations of the (first) year of analysis (year_1) in the unexposed scenario are determined as follows:
#' @details
#' First, the survival probabilities from start of year i to mid-year i in the unexposed scenario is calculated as:
#' \deqn{prob\_survival\_until\_midyear\_{mod} = 1 - \frac{1 - prob\_survival\_mod}{2}}
#' Second, the mid-year populations of the (first) year of analysis (year_1) in the unexposed scenario is calculated:
#' \deqn{midyear\_population\_unexposed_{year_1} = entry\_population_{year_1} \times prob\_survival\_until\_midyear_{mod}}

#' @details
#' \emph{\strong{Population projection}}
#' @details
#' Using the age group-specific and scenario-specific survival probabilities calculated above, future populations of each age-group under each scenario are calculated.
#' @details
#' \emph{\strong{Unexposed scenario}} The entry and mid-year population projections of in the exposed scenario is done as follows:
#' @details
#' First, the entry population of year i+1 is calculated (which is the same as the end of year population of year i) by multiplying the entry population of year i and the modified survival probabilities.
#' \deqn{entry\_population_{i+1} = entry\_population_i \times prob\_survival\_mod}
#' Second, the mid-year population of year i+1 is calculated.
#' \deqn{midyear\_population_{i+1} = entry\_population_{i+1} \times prob\_survival\_until\_midyear}
#' @details
#' \emph{\strong{Exposed scenario}} The population projections for the two possible options of \code{approach_exposure} (\code{"single_year"} and \code{"constant"}) for the unexposed scenario are different. In the case of \code{"single_year"} exposure, the population projection for the years after the year of exposure is the same as in the unexposed scenario.
#' @details
#' In the case of \code{"constant"} the population projection is done as follows:
#' @details
#' First, the entry population of year i+1 is calculated (which is the same as the end of year population of year i) using the entry population of year i.
#' \deqn{entry\_population_{i+1} = entry\_population_i \times prob\_survival}
#' Second, the mid-year population of year i+1 is calculated.
#' \deqn{midyear\_population_{i+1} = entry\_population_{i+1} \times prob\_survival\_until\_midyear}

#' @details
#' \strong{Conversion of alternative risk measures to relative risks}
#' @details
#' For conversion of hazard ratios and/or odds ratios to relative risks refer to https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13197 and/or use the conversion tool for hazard ratios (https://ebm-helper.cn/en/Conv/HR_RR.html) and/or odds ratios (https://ebm-helper.cn/en/Conv/OR_RR.html).
