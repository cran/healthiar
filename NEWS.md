# healthiar 0.2.4
* 12 March 2026

## Bug Fixes
- Previously, monetize() used the argument inflation_factor for both adjusting discount_rate and increasing value overtime. 
This has been resolved by introducing a new argument called real_growth_rate.  
Now, inflation_rate is used exclusively for adjusting discount_rate, 
while real_growth_rate handles value growth overtime. 

## Other improvements
- get_discount_factor() previously had inflation_rate as argument. 
Now, not anymore to keep different concepts separated.

# healthiar 0.2.3
* 19 February 2026

## New features
- Using compare() after standardizing results from attribute_health() now works
- For the sub-group analysis, exposure value can be specific for each geo_id_micro AND info column
- The argument social_indicator and geo_id_micro in socialize() can now use tidy data
- monetize() works after compare()
- prepare_exposure() works for gridded population data 

## Bug Fixes
- Using socialize() and standardize() without ref_prop_pop now works properly
- Now attribute_lifetable() allows all lengths for age group (before, only 100 age categories were allowed)
- The data validation now identifies correctly whether the argument n_years was entered by the user or not

## Testing
- 31 additional internal tests

## Other improvements
- The argument n_years has no default value anymore in monetize() and discount()
- Error message if monetize() is used after compare() with different year of analysis or baseline health data in the two scenarios (not attributable to policy intervention) 
- More complete warning message if absolute risk and cutoff is provided 



# healthiar 0.2.2
* 08 January 2026

- Amendments in readme file in terms of contents and structure including URL to new healthiar website
- Updated and fixed citation

## Testing
- Around 70 additional internal tests for attribute_health()
