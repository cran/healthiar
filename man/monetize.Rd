\title{Monetize health impacts}
\usage{
monetize(
  output_attribute = NULL,
  impact = NULL,
  valuation,
  discount_rate = NULL,
  discount_shape = "exponential",
  n_years = 0,
  inflation_rate = NULL,
  info = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_attribute}{\code{List} produced by \code{healthiar::attribute()} or \code{healthiar::compare()} as results.}

\item{impact}{\code{Numberic value} referring to the health impacts to be monetized (without attribute function). If a \code{Numberic vector} is entered multiple assessments (by year) will be carried out. Be aware that the value for year 0 (current) must be entered, while n_years does not include the year 0. Thus, length of impact = n_years + 1.}

\item{valuation}{\code{Numberic value} referring to unit value of a health impact.}

\item{discount_rate}{\code{Numeric value} showing the discount rate for future years. If it is a nominal discount rate, no inflation is to be entered. If it is a real discount rate, the result can be adjusted by entering inflation in this function.}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. By default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{n_years}{\code{Numeric value} referring to number of years in the future to be considered in the discounting and/or inflation. Be aware that the year 0 (without discounting/inflation, i.e. the present) is not be counted here. If a vector is entered in the argument impact, n_years does not need to be entered (length of impact = n_years + 1).}

\item{inflation_rate}{\code{Numeric value} between 0 and 1 referring to the annual inflation (increase of prices). Only to be entered if nominal (not real) discount rate is entered in the function. Default value = NULL (assuming no nominal discount rate).}

\item{info}{\code{String}, \code{data frame} or \code{tibble} providing \strong{information about the assessment}. Only attached if \code{impact} is entered by the users. If \code{output_attribute} is entered, use \code{info} in that function or add the column manually. \emph{Optional argument.}}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{list} containing:

1) \code{monetization_main} (\code{tibble}) containing the main monetized results;
\itemize{
 \item \code{monetized_impact} (\code{numeric} column)
 \item \code{discount_factor} (\code{numeric} column) calculated based on the entered \code{discount_rate}
 \item And many more
}

2) \code{monetization_detailed} (\code{list}) containing detailed (and interim) results.
\itemize{
 \item \code{results_by_year} (\code{tibble})
 \item \code{health_raw} (\code{tibble}) containing the monetized results for each for each combination of input uncertainty that were provided to the initial \code{attribute_health()} call
}

If the argument \code{output_attribute} was specified, then the two results elements are added to the existing output.
