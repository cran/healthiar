\usage{
cba(
  output_attribute = NULL,
  impact_benefit = NULL,
  valuation,
  cost,
  discount_rate_benefit = NULL,
  discount_rate_cost = NULL,
  inflation_rate = NULL,
  discount_shape = "exponential",
  n_years_benefit = 1,
  n_years_cost = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_attribute}{\code{List} produced by \code{healthiar::attribute()} or \code{healthiar::compare()} as results.}

\item{impact_benefit}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the positive health impact as result of a reduction of harmful exposure.}

\item{valuation}{\code{Numberic value} referring to unit value of a health impact.}

\item{cost}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the investment cost to achieve the reduction of exposure.}

\item{discount_rate_benefit, discount_rate_cost}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the the discount rate used in the benefit and the cost side (respectively). Their values determine the approach of cost-benefit analysis: direct approach (if the same discount_rate is used for cost and benefit) and indirect approach (different discount rates).}

\item{inflation_rate}{\code{Numeric value} between 0 and 1 referring to the annual inflation (increase of prices). Only to be entered if nominal (not real) discount rate is entered in the function. Default value = NULL (assuming no nominal discount rate).}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. By default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{n_years_benefit, n_years_cost}{\code{Numeric value} referring to number of years in the future to be considered in the benefit and cost side (respectively). Years for discounting and/or inflation. Be aware that the year 0 (without discounting/inflation, i.e. the present) is not be counted here. If a vector is entered in the argument impact, n_years does not need to be entered (length of impact = n_years + 1)}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{list} containing:

1) \code{cba_main} (\code{tibble}) containing the main CBA results;
\itemize{
 \item \code{net_benefit} (\code{numeric} column) containing the difference between benefit and cost (i.e. benefit - cost)
 \item \code{benefit} (\code{numeric} column) containing discounted benefit (i.e. monetized attributable health impact)
 \item \code{cost} (\code{numeric} column) containing discounted cost
 \item And many more
}

2) \code{cba_detailed} (\code{list}) containing detailed (and interim) results.
\itemize{
 \item \code{benefit} (\code{list})
 \item \code{cost} (\code{tibble})
}

If the argument \code{output_attribute} was specified, then the two results elements are added to the existing output.
