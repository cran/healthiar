## Introduction

*healthiar* is an R package to quantify and monetize health impacts attributable to exposure (e.g. air pollution, noise...) in a study area. Using *healthiar*, you can ...

- Quantify health impacts choosing among multiple input data formats and calculation pathways:

   - Exposure data as single value or as distribution
   
   - Relative risk or absolute risk
   
   - Fixed-shape or user-defined exposure-response functions
   
   - Single or age-specific baseline health data (life table approach)

- Iterate across geographical units

- Compare scenarios

- Include and summarize uncertainties

- Monetize health impacts or perform cost-benefit analyses adjusting for inflation and discounting

- Consider social inequalities in the assessment and stratify the results

## Getting started 
To get started with the `healthiar` R package, we recommend to look at the vignette (~ package manual) *intro_to_healthiar*, which you cou can access

a) on the [package website](https://swisstph.github.io/healthiar/articles/index.html) (recommended)

b) in R Studio: Click on the *Packages* tab in RStudio, scroll down to the *healthiar* package and clicking on the hyperlinks *healthiar* > *User guides, package vignettes and other documentation* 

c) in the web browser: Run `browseVignettes("healthiar")` in the R console and the page will open up in your browser

Additionally, a 45 minutes introduction to the package can be found [here](https://team.swisstph.ch/s/aN_wN5MUTAS3bwEkWvtvaQ). The slides of the presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/SwissTPH/healthiar/tree/master/varia/Workshops_and_demos/workshop)

See the function help pages for information about specific functions. In RStudio, you can access the function documentation of e.g. the function `attribute_health` by

a) going to the [reference page of the package website](https://swisstph.github.io/healthiar/reference/index.html)

b) running `?attribute_health` in RStudio (with `healthiar` loaded)

c) going to the `Packages tab` and then clicking on `healthiar`

We recommend to frequently install the newest *healthiar* version. Please note that **`healthiar` requires R version 4.3.0 or higher**. There are two options to install *healthiar*:

a) **From CRAN**: Click on the *Packages* tab in RStudio and on the *Install* button. Leave the *Install from:* option set to *Reporsitory (CRAN)* and then search and select *healthiar* and finally click on *Install*, keeping *Install dependencies* activated.

b) **From Github (most recent version)**: Run the following commands below in RStudio to install *healthiar*:
- `install.packages(c("knitr", "rmarkdown"))`
- `remotes::install_github(repo = "SwissTPH/healthiar", build_vignettes = TRUE)`
- Note: install or update all package dependencies (= other packages that are needed for *healthiar*) if you get asked to do so

**After installation**, do not forget to load the package by running the call `library(healthiar)`.
